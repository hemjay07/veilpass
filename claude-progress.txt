#### 2. Init.sh Script Created
- Development environment setup script
- Checks Node.js version (18+ required)
- Installs dependencies automatically
- Creates .env.local with generated ENCRYPTION_SECRET
- Prints helpful startup information
- Starts the dev server

#### 3. Git Repository Initialized
- Created initial commit with README.md, init.sh, .gitignore, .env.example
- Second commit with full project structure

#### 4. Project Structure Created
Complete Next.js 14 project with:

**Configuration:**
- package.json with all dependencies
- tailwind.config.ts with dark mode and custom colors
- tsconfig.json for TypeScript
- components.json for shadcn/ui

**Source Code:**
- `/src/types/index.ts` - All TypeScript interfaces
- `/src/lib/` - Core libraries:
  - crypto.ts (client-safe)
  - crypto.server.ts (server-only Node.js crypto)
  - solana.ts (Solana connection utilities)
  - kv.ts (Storage abstraction)
  - kv-local.ts (Local development mock)
  - attestation.ts (Attestation business logic)
  - disclosure.ts (Disclosure business logic)
  - validation.ts (Zod schemas)
  - utils.ts (shadcn utilities)

**Components:**
- Layout: Header, Footer, Container
- Wallet: WalletProvider, WalletButton
- UI: button, card, input, label, select, checkbox, toast, dialog (shadcn)

**Pages:**
- `/` - Landing page with hero, features, CTA
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard with quick actions
- `/mint` - Token creation form (demo)
- `/attest` - Attestation generation form
- `/disclose` - Disclosure creation form
- `/verify/[id]` - Verification page for auditors

**API Routes:**
- `POST /api/attestations/generate` - Generate new attestation
- `POST /api/attestations/verify` - Verify attestation with secret
- `POST /api/disclosures/create` - Create disclosure link
- `GET /api/disclosures/[id]` - Verify and access disclosure

### Build Status
- Production build passes successfully
- All TypeScript types compile without errors
- No console errors expected

### Next Agent Tasks
The next agent should:
1. Use `feature_get_next` to get the highest-priority pending feature
2. Implement the feature according to app_spec.txt
3. Test thoroughly before marking as passing
4. Commit progress before session ends

### Environment Notes
- ENCRYPTION_SECRET required in .env.local (64-char hex)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL defaults to http://localhost:3000
- Vercel KV is optional (local mock used if not configured)
- Phantom wallet extension recommended for testing

### Git Log
```
