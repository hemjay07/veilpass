# VeilPass Development Progress

## Operational Notes
- Start app: `npm run dev` (runs on port 3000)
- Dev server compiles pages on first request (may be slow initially)
- Local KV mock is used for development - data doesn't persist between server restarts
- Vercel KV (Upstash Redis) configured in .env.local for production persistence
- ENCRYPTION_SECRET is set in .env.local (64-char hex)
- GOTCHA: The /verify/[id] page has slow initial hydration - may need page refresh
- GOTCHA: pino-pretty warning in console (from wallet-adapter) - harmless, ignore it
- API endpoints work correctly: /api/attestations/generate, /api/attestations/verify, /api/disclosures/{id}
- Wallet connection requires Phantom browser extension for full testing
- Many features can be verified by code review when they depend on wallet interaction
- NEW: Two-value border radius system: --radius (6px) for buttons/inputs, --radius-lg (12px) for cards
- NEW: Focus ring utility class `.focus-ring` for consistent keyboard focus states
- NEW: Hover utilities `.nav-link` and `.card-hover` for touch-friendly hover effects
- NEW: Reduced motion support - global @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) rules in globals.css
- NEW: Skeleton component for loading states with motion-reduce support
- NEW: Spinner component with linear easing and motion-reduce support
- NEW: Typography: font smoothing, tracking-tight headings, tabular-nums utility
- NEW: Landing page uses F-pattern layout (left-aligned content)
- NEW: TrustBar component below header with privacy modal
- NEW: TrustBadges with hover tooltips on landing hero
- NEW: Accordion component for Privacy Explainer section
- NEW: JourneySteps horizontal stepper visualization
- NEW: AuthenticitySeal on verify page with timestamp and proof hash
- NEW: Consistent spacing scale with CSS custom properties
